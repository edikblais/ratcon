ncomm_blais_check_tasks.m

This MATLAB script imports iRno and iHsa into the RAVEN toolbox and performs the checkTasks function for 327 metabolic tasks described in Supplementary Table 4. Most tasks capture metabolic functions that are common to both rats and humans. Some tasks are meant to fail in both organisms while others are meant to fail in only one organism, consistent with known species-specific differences between rat and human metabolism.
